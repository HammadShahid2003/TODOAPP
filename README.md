# To-Do List Application

A simple and effective **To-Do List** application with a splash screen, task management, and a responsive user interface.

## 🚀 Objective
The goal of this project is to create a **basic To-Do List application** where users can add, view, and manage tasks. The app includes a splash screen with animations, uses fragments for task entry, and features a responsive UI using `ConstraintLayout`.

## 🌟 Features
- **Splash Screen** with Translate and Scale Animations
- **Main To-Do List Page** with an Add Task Button
- **Task Input Fragment** for task name and description
- **Responsive UI** using `ConstraintLayout`, adaptable to both portrait and landscape modes

## 📋 Development Guidelines
- All strings must be stored in `strings.xml`.
- All dimensions must be defined in `dimens.xml`.
- All colors should be declared in `colors.xml`.
- Layouts must be responsive using `ConstraintLayout`.
- Consistency in design, colors, fonts, and spacing is essential.

## 💻 Deliverables
- XML layouts for each screen and fragment.
- Java code for splash screen animations, fragment navigation, and task list functionality.
- Fragment lifecycle events should be logged (e.g., `onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`).
- Ensure a fully responsive design across all screens.

## 📱 App Flow
1. **Splash Screen**: Displays the app’s logo and features animations.
    - **Translate**: Logo moves from the top of the screen to the center.
    - **Scale**: Logo grows slightly in size as it moves.
2. **Main Screen**: Displays the to-do list and an "Add New Task" button (FAB).
3. **Task Input Fragment**: Users input task details (title, description) and press Save to add the task to the list.
4. **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes and orientations using `ConstraintLayout`.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Android SDK** for app development.
- **ConstraintLayout** for building responsive UI.
- **Java** for backend logic and fragment management.

## 🔄 Navigation
- `StartActivityForResult` is used to manage navigation between activities.
- Splash screen navigation is implemented after animations complete.

## 📂 File Structure
- **`strings.xml`**: Contains all app text.
- **`dimens.xml`**: Defines dimensions used throughout the app.
- **`colors.xml`**: Stores color definitions for consistent theming.

## 🎨 Design Consistency
- Maintain a unified design across all screens, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Buttons, forms, and inputs are clearly labeled and user-friendly.

## 🧪 Testing
- Test the navigation flow to ensure smooth transitions between screens and fragments.
- Validate that the UI remains responsive on different screen sizes and orientations.
